To design and implement a CI/CD pipeline for a single-page web application built in Node.js, we'll use GitLab for version control and CI/CD automation. We'll also use Terraform to define the infrastructure required for hosting the web application.
Here are the steps to set up the CI/CD pipeline:
  
1.	`Source Code Repository`:
  •	Create a Git repository for your Node.js web application.
  •	Place your Node.js web application source code in the repository.
2.	Infrastructure as Code:
  •	Use Terraform to define the infrastructure required for hosting the web application (e.g., cloud server, network configuration, etc.).
  •	Write a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) to provision the necessary resources. Include any dependencies required for running the web application (e.g., Node.js runtime).
  •	Commit the Terraform configuration file to your Git repository.
3.	CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
  •	Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your Git repository. This file describes the stages and jobs of your CI/CD pipeline.
  •	Configure the pipeline stages for building, testing, and deploying the web application.
4.	CI/CD Pipeline Stages:
•	`Build Stage`:
  •	In the build stage, you'll install the project dependencies and build the web application.
  •	Use a job to install Node.js and the required dependencies by specifying the Node.js version and running npm install.
  •	Add a job to build the web application by running any necessary build commands (e.g., npm run build).
  •	Ensure the build artifacts are stored for later stages.
•	`Test Stage`:
  •	In the test stage, you'll run tests to validate the functionality of your web application.
  •	Use a job to run tests by executing appropriate test commands (e.g., npm run test).
  •	Ensure the test results are captured and accessible.
•	`Deploy Stage`:
  •	In the deploy stage, you'll deploy the web application to the defined infrastructure.
  •	Use a job to deploy the application by running the necessary deployment commands (e.g., copying the build artifacts to the server).
  •	You can use tools like SSH or a deployment agent to connect to the infrastructure and deploy the web application.
  •	Optionally, you can include a step to clean up any previous deployments or perform blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates.
5.	`Web Application Endpoint URL`:
  •	After the deployment stage, your web application should be accessible at a specific endpoint URL.
  •	Depending on your infrastructure setup, this could be an IP address, domain, or load balancer URL.

To use this Terraform configuration file:

• Replace the placeholder values, such as YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY, YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY, your-key-pair-name, and the ami value with appropriate values for your AWS account and setup.
• Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
• Initialize the Terraform project by running terraform init.
• Plan and review the changes by running terraform plan.
• Apply the changes and provision the infrastructure by running terraform apply.
• After the infrastructure is provisioned, Terraform will output the public IP address of the web server. You can use this IP address to access  web application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this  .gitlab-ci.yml file:

• The pipeline is divided into three stages: build, test, and deploy.
• The before_script section installs the project dependencies before each job.
• The build job runs the npm run build command to build the web application. The build artifacts are stored as artifacts to be used in the deployment stage.
• The test job runs the npm run test command to execute tests for the web application.
• The deploy job is responsible for deploying the web application to the server. It uses SSH to connect to the server and secure copy (scp) to transfer the build artifacts to the server's /var/www/html/$APP_NAME directory.
