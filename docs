To design and implement a CI/CD pipeline for a single-page web application built in Node.js, we'll use GitLab for version control and CI/CD automation. We'll also use Terraform to define the infrastructure required for hosting the web application.
Here are the steps to set up the CI/CD pipeline:
  
1.	`Source Code Repository`:
•	Create a Git repository for your Node.js web application.
•	Place your Node.js web application source code in the repository.
2.	Infrastructure as Code:
•	Use Terraform to define the infrastructure required for hosting the web application (e.g., cloud server, network configuration, etc.).
•	Write a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) to provision the necessary resources. Include any dependencies required for running the web application (e.g., Node.js runtime).
•	Commit the Terraform configuration file to your Git repository.
3.	CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
•	Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your Git repository. This file describes the stages and jobs of your CI/CD pipeline.
•	Configure the pipeline stages for building, testing, and deploying the web application.
4.	CI/CD Pipeline Stages:
•	`Build Stage`:
•	In the build stage, you'll install the project dependencies and build the web application.
•	Use a job to install Node.js and the required dependencies by specifying the Node.js version and running npm install.
•	Add a job to build the web application by running any necessary build commands (e.g., npm run build).
•	Ensure the build artifacts are stored for later stages.
•	`Test Stage`:
•	In the test stage, you'll run tests to validate the functionality of your web application.
•	Use a job to run tests by executing appropriate test commands (e.g., npm run test).
•	Ensure the test results are captured and accessible.
•	`Deploy Stage`:
•	In the deploy stage, you'll deploy the web application to the defined infrastructure.
•	Use a job to deploy the application by running the necessary deployment commands (e.g., copying the build artifacts to the server).
•	You can use tools like SSH or a deployment agent to connect to the infrastructure and deploy the web application.
•	Optionally, you can include a step to clean up any previous deployments or perform blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates.
5.	`Web Application Endpoint URL`:
•	After the deployment stage, your web application should be accessible at a specific endpoint URL.
•	Depending on your infrastructure setup, this could be an IP address, domain, or load balancer URL.
